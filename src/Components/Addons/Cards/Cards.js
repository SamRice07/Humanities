      <h2>Hitler</h2>
      <p>Hitler was an example of the destructive ability of motivation. In similarity to Gatsby, he rose from a very difficult position to one at the very top, unlike Gatsby he wielded the power of this position devastatingly. Regardless of his intentions he did have a natural drive for his version of improvement and achieved greater and greater things in accordance with his goals.</p>

      <h2>Gatsby</h2>
      <p>Gatsby is perhaps the best example of motivation and ever-rising goals in anything we learned this year. He was truly from the very bottom and climbed to the very top and although he had one main goal throughout along his path towards it he made many smaller ones but nonetheless important goals. He has shown tremendous resilience and drive and is an example of the capability of every human being.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Everything covered in H9 this year has shown, in some form, a goal and a motivation to achieve it. Motivation isn't something you can learn but you are born with, everyone is born with it but very few know how to use it. Throughout this unit, we have learned more and more about humans and the great power they have when push comes to shove. Humans will forever have an innate need for improvement which will always cause them to strive for greater and greater aspirations.</p>
